        <p>To those of you who give advice on which languages, methodologies, architectures, or whatever else to use, I want to start by saying thank you. Your advice is vital to the growth of millions of people like me who are early in their careers.</p>
<p>But I've noticed a pattern with software engineering advice that leads to over-engineering and unnecessary arguments. So I have a request:</p>
<p align="center"><em>Please make your advice more specific</em></p>
<p>It's too often overlooked that there isn't just one type of &quot;software&quot;, thus it is rare for advice to be applicable to every situation. For example, advice for testing a small B2B web app might not work for embedded device firmware. But it might work for a large B2C web app. And since readers will rarely have experience in all of those situations, I think we should start being more explicit about the applicability of our advice.</p>
<p>Being more specific might help address two big time sinks in the industry:</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/cargo_culting">Cargo-culting</a>, like when people read how great Kubernetes works for Netflix, but then they decide to use it for a little Django app (that was me a few years ago).</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/bikeshedding">Bikeshedding</a>, like when people argue incessantly that a language is useless because it can't be used in some niche.</li>
</ol>
<p>A good start might be answering questions like the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does your advice apply to my scale? (local restaurant website vs. Youtube.com)</li>
<li>Does your advice apply to my type of product? (library, web app, CLI tool, firmware, on/off-premise, etc.)</li>
<li>Does your advice apply to my type of users? (developers, enterprises, regular people, etc.)</li>
<li>If not, what should I use instead? (like <a href="https://adamdrake.com/command-line-tools-can-be-235x-faster-than-your-hadoop-cluster.html">replacing Hadoop with <code>find/xargs/awk</code></a>)</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, it's hard to find the right balance between hand-holding readers or just saying &quot;buyer beware&quot;. But hopefully spending time to add an extra subheading on &quot;Applicability&quot; to READMEs or blog posts will pay for itself in time spent over-engineering and arguing over minutiae.</p>
