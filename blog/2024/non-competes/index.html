        <p>If you're reading this blog, there's a high chance that you are one of the 1-in-5 workers who has a non-compete clause hiding in your employment contract. These are clauses that prevent workers from taking other jobs or starting other businesses that "compete" with the employer after leaving the job. I originally thought they were unique to highly-paid tech jobs, but actually <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-09171/p-111">they are widespread</a>, even among workers earning less than $40,000 per year.</p>
<p><a href="https://eig.org/state-noncompete-map/">After some states banned non-competes</a>, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) was able to quantify exactly how beneficial a ban on non-competes was in those states. The benefits are massive. Non-compete clauses suppress wages, reduce innovation, increase healthcare costs, and even discourage workers from reporting (and escaping from) illegal discrimination and abuse. They published <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2024/05/07/2024-09171/non-compete-clause-rule">570 pages of research</a> on this topic, which is a good read, but you can read the <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/Non-Compete-Fact-Sheet.pdf">3-page factsheet</a> to get the gist. All evidence points to non-competes being bad news.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Quick note: I am not a lawyer, this is not legal advice.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Thankfully, despite their widespread use and some state-wide bans, non-compete clauses are considered illegal under federal law since 2023. I say "considered", because their illegality rests on shaky ground right now. It rests on two pillars:</p>
<ol>
<li>In May 2023, the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) issued a <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/nlrb-general-counsel-issues-memo-on-non-competes-violating-the-national">memo</a> saying they consider non-competes to be a violation of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA), since non-competes "interfere with, restrain, or coerce employees in the exercise of rights" such as the right to organize. This pillar is still intact.
<ul>
<li>They've also issued a <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/nlrb-general-counsel-issues-memo-with-guidance-to-regions-on-severance">memo</a> saying they consider non-disparagement clauses illegal too.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In April 2024, the FTC announced a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2024/04/ftc-announces-rule-banning-non-competes">a new rule</a> which would have banned non-competes, based on those 570 pages of research I mentioned earlier. But before the rule took effect, <a href="/blog/2024/ftc_order.pdf">a district court blocked it</a>, but the FTC can still address non-competes on a case-by-case basis. This pillar is crumbling, and faces an uncertain future in the Supreme Court.</li>
</ol>
<p>Both of these pillars could be crushed to dust depending on who ends up controlling the executive branch of government.</p>
<h2 id="why-should-i-care">Why should I care?</h2>
<p>While researching the effects of non-competes, the FTC received over <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-09171/p-75">26,000 public comments</a>, of which 96% were supportive of a ban. In these comments, I believe anyone can find a strong reason to care. (Content warning: abuse, sexual harassment)</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I am a journalist who has been forced to move across the country three times, and leave my field entirely for one year, in order to comply with stringent non-compete agreements.... In [one] situation, I was stuck working for abusive management who fostered a toxic and abusive workplace, and I had to work there for more than a year until I could find a job in another city entirely because they had threatened to sue me under the non-compete if I left and worked for another local station.... [E]ven if these clauses are unenforceable, as we've all heard before, who can afford the legal representation to go up against a corporation and their lawyers when the lawsuit threat comes? My life would have been very different if I weren't trapped by non-competes at points in my career.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I am being sued right now for going into business on my own in Boston, Massachusetts, by my former employer who says I signed a non-compete in 2003, 20 years ago.... I am fighting them in court. Hopefully I will prevail.... [The] corporation I worked for is a billion-dollar corporation. And they just keep trying scare tactics to make me back down. They went as far as trying to get a preliminary injunction ordered against me. And the judge refused but I still have to spend $1,000 an hour to defend myself.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>In October 2020, I started working as a bartender at a company called [REDACTED] for $10 an hour. On my first day, I unknowingly signed a 2-year non-compete, slipped between other paperwork while my boss rushed me, and downplayed its importance.... At [REDACTED], I was sexually harassed and emotionally abused. I needed money, so I searched for a new job while remaining at [REDACTED] for one year. I was eventually offered a bartending job at a family-owned bar with better wages, conditions, and opportunities. Upon resigning, I was threatened with a non-compete I didn't know existed. Still, I couldn't take it anymore, so believing it was an unenforceable scare tactic, I took the new job, thinking our legal system wouldn't allow a massive company with over 20 locations to sue a young entry-level worker with no degree. In December 2021, I was sued for $30,000 in “considerable and irreparable damages” for violating the non-compete...</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>I started my first job as a Nurse Practitioner in 2019. All positions I interviewed for required a non-compete.... In my case, I work for an employer that is hostile, discriminated against me during pregnancy and maternity leave and has raised his voice at me in meetings. He told me I was lucky to even have a job after becoming pregnant. I learned after starting at the practice that he has shown this pattern before with previous employees. I say this because all of these above-mentioned reasons are why I have the right to want to quit my job and move on. I desperately want to leave and start another job but I can't because of the non compete. I feel like a prisoner to my job. I feel depressed in my work conditions and I feel like I have no way out.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="what-can-i-do-about-it">What can I do about it?</h2>
<p>Thankfully, even this crumbling legal basis is one that workers can capitalize on. You see, companies are generally risk-averse and they do not like the idea of potential <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/what-we-do/investigate-charges">NLRB charges</a> or potential lawsuits from the FTC. As the FTC <a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-09171/p-1456">found</a>, there's no good evidence to suggest companies are materially harmed by the loss of non-competes, especially since they can protect their interests through NDAs and trade secret laws. So merely asking for the illegal clause to be removed from your (and your coworkers') contracts has a good chance of succeeding! All you have to do is ask.</p>
<p>Here is a template email:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Subject: Remove illegal non-compete clause from employment contract</p>
<p>Hello {name of HR representative},</p>
<p>I noticed that my employment contract includes a non-compete clause which has been considered illegal by the National Labor Relations Board since 2023. The Federal Trade Commission also considers non-compete clauses to be illegal because they stifle innovation, exploit workers, hinder the economy, and even harm employers.</p>
<p>https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/news-story/nlrb-general-counsel-issues-memo-on-non-competes-violating-the-national</p>
<p>https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/Non-Compete-Fact-Sheet.pdf</p>
<p>As a result, I'd like to formally request the removal of the non-compete clause from all standard employment contracts, including mine. This action will demonstrate that {company name} values innovation, fair competition, and the rights of its employees.</p>
<p>Looking forward to your response,</p>
<p>{your name}</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Tell your coworkers to send this email as well to support your case. Remember that the <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/rights-we-protect/your-rights/interference-with-employee-rights">National Labor Relations Act</a> protects your "right to join together to improve [your] working conditions, with or without a union".</p>
<h2 id="what-if-they-say-no">What if they say no?</h2>
<p>I'd recommend reminding them of your options for reporting noncompliance with the law:</p>
<ul>
<li>Labor rights violations can be <a href="https://www.nlrb.gov/about-nlrb/what-we-do/investigate-charges">reported to the NLRB by filing a charge</a>.</li>
<li>Violations of the FTC's rule against non-competes can be reported to <a href="mailto:non-compete@ftc.gov">non-compete@ftc.gov</a>. They can still choose to enforce the rule on a case-by-case basis.</li>
</ul>
<p>It doesn't have to come to that though. You just need to inspire enough fear to convince a senior employee to look into it, and possibly spend the paltry (<a href="https://www.federalregister.gov/d/2024-09171/p-2296">FTC-estimated</a>) $670 of lawyer-time to change it.</p>
<p>If they still say no, then this is a good history lesson that merely trying to convince powerful entities like companies to act contrary to their self-interest generally <a href="https://www.radicalinprogress.org/kendi-2019-summary-part-4">does not work</a>. Change is primarily accomplished through the wielding of power to enact policy changes. Another way to do that is to convince your elected representatives to ban non-competes, who are (in theory) self-interested in helping you. You can find contact information for your representatives <a href="https://www.usa.gov/elected-officials/">here</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you live in <a href="https://eig.org/state-noncompete-map/">a state that already has strong bans</a> against non-competes, then contact your senators to support House or Senate bills like the <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/220">Workforce Mobility Act</a>.</li>
<li>Otherwise, contact your state representatives to introduce a bill that bans non-competes in your state, or to support existing bills if you see one <a href="https://eig.org/state-noncompete-map/">here</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The world has enough horribly exploitative things happening in it. Let's rid the world of this one.</p>
