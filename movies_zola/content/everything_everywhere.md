I don't think I need to write much to justify giving a perfect score to probably the greatest independent film to come out this decade.

My scoring system gives a lot of weight to "missed opportunities", and this film doesn't miss. Amazing story, characters, acting, message, visuals, and everything else I can think of.

The other part of my scoring system is more feeling-based. How I see it, movies either show a fake, fantastical world where the good guys always win, or they show the real, messy world that has no rhyme or reason. By embracing absurdism and approaching it honestly, the movie manages to do what I thought was impossible: present a unique message that rings true, while also managing to be uplifting.
