I loved _Twisters_, and I'm not even a fan of the genre which is a testament to its quality. The concept of a smug influencer storm chaser meeting a by-the-books meterologist is just inherently entertaining. Glen Powell has made a fan of me due to his performance that another reviewer called worthy of "an Oscar for smugness".

Seeing this movie near the opening night in a packed theater also helped the experience. With so many movies coming out in theaters and on streaming services, it's like the concept of a "blockbuster" has been lost in recent years. You can't have a cultural moment centered around a dozen different movies every year, much to the chagrin of studio execs. It's only possible in moderation.

Given _Twister (1996)_ already had a committed fanbase, people showed up to the theater wearing custom T-shirts and left with big smiles. Critics didn't like either the original movie or this remake very much, but I can tell you this is one of those times where the critics are missing the forest for the trees.

If you're entertained by artsyness, then _Twisters_ is not for you. If you're entertained by endearing idiots shooting fireworks into a tornado while blasting _Ain't No Love In Oklahoma_, then this movie is pure entertainment from start to finish.
