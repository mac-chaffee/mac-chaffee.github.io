_80 for Brady_ had great marketing since the concept is so inherently funny. We watched all three of Jane Fonda's movies in 2023 (how does she do it?) and this is the best one. But with such a great concept comes high expectations of the comedy, which didn't land for me.

Despite this flaw, I think it can hold up as any other classic feel-good comedy. Something about the editing or the music feels nostalgic, hearkening back to sport-comedies around the 2000s like maybe _Talladega Nights_, _The Waterboy_, or _Dodgeball_. I guess _80 for Brady_ is a bit more serious than those movies, especially the thing Jane Fonda's character is being secretive about, culminating in her (amazing) monologue. But like all those other movies, they aren't that laugh-out-loud funny, but consistently funny enough and well-written enough to become classics.

For all those reasons, we ended up watching this movie again a year later. Just like those other classic movies, it's eminently rewatchable, which is higher praise than the middling score implies.
