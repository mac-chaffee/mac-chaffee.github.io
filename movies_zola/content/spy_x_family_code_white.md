_Spy x Family_ sets a great example for how to make a good movie based on an anime. There's just so much room for entertainment when you have a concept like a spy father, an assassin mother, and a mind-reader daughter that it would be hard to mess this up. With great action and a great ending, they stuck the landing (no pun intended).
