"Punchy" is an adjective I often use to describe delicious, strong-tasting food when I can't come up with a better word (I'm barely a film critic, definitely not a food critic). I think it describes this movie perfectly, and the pun is definitely intended.

There's a lot to love about this movie. Obviously the stunts are great, but the writing and acting are equally great. The cover of _I Was Made For Lovin' You_ is great, including the little instrumental motifs every now and then.

But more than anything, this movie really succeeds in writing a love letter to stunt performers and the art of movie-making in general. I wouldn't be surprised if this movie inspires some people to persue a career in film-making. It's definitely inspired me to read more about it.

We re-watched this movie again about a week later, where my score lowered to a 5 due to discovering a few more plot holes, like why did the drug dealer guy even need to exist? Just to have a trippy fight scene? But my original score still stands.
