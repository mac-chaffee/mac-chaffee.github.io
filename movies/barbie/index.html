    <p>I heard this movie was re-written over and over again throughout the years. I think it shows, in a good way. It was able to navigate the fraught waters that Barbie exists in.</p>
<p>Given this is an official Mattel product, audiences will walk in with an air of skepticism (I know I did). If they couldn't laugh at themselves, then it would have flopped. But the decision to cast an unhinged Will Ferrell as the CEO of Mattel alleviated those concerns right away.</p>
<p>But let's focus on the real strength of this movie: Margot Robbie and America Ferrera's stand-out performances, under the expert direction of Greta Gerwig, expert writing, expert supporting actors, iconic wardrobe, ingenious set design, and amazing music. One of the only times I wanted a single movie to absolutely sweep the Oscars.</p>
<p>Something I don't see many people talking about is how all the scenes in "Barbie-land" are written like a scenario a kid would come up with. Like Ken running into the ocean to impress Barbie, then bouncing off the (plastic) waves, flying through the air, and landing on the (plastic) beach. It's a testament to the writers that the childish whimsy blends cleanly into the background, since too much of it would of course feel like it was written by a child.</p>
<p>And I'm a sucker for a good monologue, since they always remind me of <em>Independence Day</em>. They have to be both well-written and well-performed, and America Ferrera's delivery ensured this monologue can stand with the greats.</p>
<p>This is another movie we rewatched, which is high praise coming from me.</p>
