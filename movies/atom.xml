          &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Wild Robot&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is a beautiful film that strikes a great balance between kid-friendliness while also having mature themes that appeal to parents. Between the heart-wrenching (in a good way) scenes of love and loss, there&#x27;s even good comic relief that the whole theater enjoyed. My one complaint is the incoherent moral message with regard to animals.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Popular media with talking animals usually treats the main characters like humans, then overlays the familiar &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.animal-ethics.org&#x2F;speciesism&#x2F;&quot;&gt;speciesism&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; on top. If a main character suffers or dies, it&#x27;s treated seriously, but there may be &quot;lesser&quot; animals whose suffering is unaddressed or even treated as a joke (&lt;em&gt;Shark Tale&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; comes to mind). &lt;em&gt;The Wild Robot&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; falls into the same trap despite trying to avoid it. The first two kinds of animals we see are cute otters that are protected from harm and crabs (&quot;lesser&quot; animals) that are killed and eaten as a joke several times in the movie. The crabs are not given the ability to talk to further reinforce this hierarchy.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Additionally, I saw one review praising the movie for not shying away from showing dead animals to kids. I hate that kind of intentional desensitization of kids. Sometimes, the inconsistencies of our &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Carnism&quot;&gt;carnist&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; society are so clear that even kids pick up on them, like being taught to help an injured bird while also being taught to &quot;get used to&quot; slaughtering chickens for food. &lt;em&gt;The Wild Robot&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; does at times try to tell us that an overwhelming amount of animal suffering is &quot;just the way things go&quot;, which is exactly that kind of desensitization I dislike (while also being &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;veganstrategist.org&#x2F;2016&#x2F;06&#x2F;01&#x2F;the-extremely-inconvenient-truth-of-wild-animal-suffering&#x2F;?doing_wp_cron=1727750443.3923718929290771484375&quot;&gt;untrue&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But overall, given that no major motion picture I&#x27;ve seen has ever intelligently addressed the concept of animal suffering, my rating is only minorly affected by this oversight. It really is the only flaw I could find in an otherwise amazing movie. Imagine if I subtracted several points every time a movie did something else that was wildly common like including establishing shots...&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          This movie really soars, despite a few bugs in the system. 9.5 out of 10.

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://www.macchaffee.com/movies/beetlejuice-beetlejuice/">
          &lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: This review contains indirect spoilers.&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;&#x2F;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If &lt;em&gt;Beetlejuice&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; was &quot;probably good, but I don&#x27;t get it&quot;, &lt;em&gt;Beetlejuice Beetlejuice&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is firmly in the &quot;not good but I guess it&#x27;s okay if you like it&quot; camp for me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For one, the original film had its fair share of gore and gross-out humor, but it was never the main point and always had that classic Tim Burton goofiness that made it fun. But this sequel has lost sight of that balance, choosing instead to bring it into (the already crowded) spotlight.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The crowdedness is another problem. This movie has a B, C, and D plot, which sucks up all the screen time. There&#x27;s the funeral plot, the wedding plot, the teens&#x27; plot, the ex-wife plot, the actor-turned-police-chief plot, the shrunken head plot, the grieving wife plot, the toxic boyfriend plot, and the mother-daughter plot. By jamming all of this into one movie, many of these plots don&#x27;t conclude in a satisfying way. Especially the wedding plot, which is resolved with a single hand-wavey sentence from Astrid (Jenna Ortega).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In addition to having too much gore, there&#x27;s also too many gross manipulative relationships: three of them! Having one would be good social commentary, but three feels like reducing this movie&#x27;s women to mere plot devices, used to increase the notoriety of the male villians.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, &lt;em&gt;Everyone&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is wacky in this movie. There are just no &lt;em&gt;normal&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; people in this movie to act as foils to all the wacky characters. In the original, you have Barbara and Adam to contrast against the Deetz family. When everyone&#x27;s unhinged, it starts to be a little one-note. Why revive a 36-year-old franchise just to be one-note?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          This juice is an acquired taste, if you have none. 4 out of 10.

          &lt;p&gt;I loved &lt;em&gt;Twisters&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, and I&#x27;m not even a fan of the genre which is a testament to its quality. The concept of a smug influencer storm chaser meeting a by-the-books meterologist is just inherently entertaining. Glen Powell has made a fan of me due to his performance that another reviewer called worthy of &quot;an Oscar for smugness&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Seeing this movie near the opening night in a packed theater also helped the experience. With so many movies coming out in theaters and on streaming services, it&#x27;s like the concept of a &quot;blockbuster&quot; has been lost in recent years. You can&#x27;t have a cultural moment centered around a dozen different movies every year, much to the chagrin of studio execs. It&#x27;s only possible in moderation.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given &lt;em&gt;Twister (1996)&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; already had a committed fanbase, people showed up to the theater wearing custom T-shirts and left with big smiles. Critics didn&#x27;t like either the original movie or this remake very much, but I can tell you this is one of those times where the critics are missing the forest for the trees.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you&#x27;re entertained by artsyness, then &lt;em&gt;Twisters&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is not for you. If you&#x27;re entertained by endearing idiots shooting fireworks into a tornado while blasting &lt;em&gt;Ain&#x27;t No Love In Oklahoma&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, then this movie is pure entertainment from start to finish.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          Is this what it feels like to watch a "blockbuster"? 9.5 out of 10.

          &lt;p&gt;&quot;Punchy&quot; is an adjective I often use to describe delicious, strong-tasting food when I can&#x27;t come up with a better word (I&#x27;m barely a film critic, definitely not a food critic). I think it describes this movie perfectly, and the pun is definitely intended.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There&#x27;s a lot to love about this movie. Obviously the stunts are great, but the writing and acting are equally great. The cover of &lt;em&gt;I Was Made For Lovin&#x27; You&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is great, including the little instrumental motifs every now and then.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But more than anything, this movie really succeeds in writing a love letter to stunt performers and the art of movie-making in general. I wouldn&#x27;t be surprised if this movie inspires some people to persue a career in film-making. It&#x27;s definitely inspired me to read more about it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We re-watched this movie again about a week later, where my score lowered to a 5 due to discovering a few more plot holes, like why did the drug dealer guy even need to exist? Just to have a trippy fight scene? But my original score still stands.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          Punchy! 8 out of 10.

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Spy x Family&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; sets a great example for how to make a good movie based on an anime.

With great action and a great ending, they stuck the landing (no pun intended).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;As of 2024, this movie has the lowest score of any movie I&#x27;ve watched, and for good reason. This is the only movie that was so bad I walked out of the theater.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It&#x27;s a movie of inexplicable contraditions. The characters feel flat and rigid despite their loose attempts at ad-libbing. The comic relief is inserted very intentionally by an airport announcer voice, but it seems no intentionality was expended on the writing of these jokes. The story is bizarre and unique but somehow utterly boring. The conversational topics are so relatable that they become banal (phones are bad, people age, weather exists).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The strange technique of revealing major pieces of information in the middle of unrelated conversations became an inside joke for me and my wife. Nobody talks like that, which makes it funny but also breaks the illusion. Suddenly you&#x27;re not experiencing a story, you&#x27;re sitting in a theater watching a movie with a shoe-string budget that has nothing compelling other than this artificial drip-drip of backstory.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          It's just one long boring conversation. 1.5 out of 10.

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://www.macchaffee.com/movies/barbie/">
          &lt;p&gt;I heard this movie was re-written over and over again throughout the years. I think it shows, in a good way. It was able to navigate the fraught waters that Barbie exists in.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Given this is an official Mattel product, audiences will walk in with an air of skepticism (I know I did). If they couldn&#x27;t laugh at themselves, then it would have flopped. But the decision to cast an unhinged Will Ferrell as the CEO of Mattel alleviated those concerns right away.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But let&#x27;s focus on the real strength of this movie: Margot Robbie and America Ferrera&#x27;s stand-out performances, under the expert direction of Greta Gerwig, expert writing, expert supporting actors, iconic wardrobe, ingenious set design, and amazing music. One of the only times I wanted a single movie to absolutely sweep the Oscars.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Something I don&#x27;t see many people talking about is how all the scenes in &quot;Barbie-land&quot; are written like a scenario a kid would come up with. Like Ken running into the ocean to impress Barbie, then bouncing off the (plastic) waves, flying through the air, and landing on the (plastic) beach. It&#x27;s a testament to the writers that the childish whimsy blends cleanly into the background, since too much of it would of course feel like it was written by a child.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And I&#x27;m a sucker for a good monologue, since they always remind me of &lt;em&gt;Independence Day&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. They have to be both well-written and well-performed, and America Ferrera&#x27;s delivery ensured this monologue can stand with the greats.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This is another movie we rewatched, which is high praise coming from me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          Funny, smart, and topical without being cringy. 8.5 out of 10.

          &lt;p&gt;We watched this at 10:30AM, then Barbie at 4:30PM. Happy to have particiated in an unhinged internet meme.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          More like a History Channel special than a movie. 7 out of 10.

        <content type="html" xml:base="https://www.macchaffee.com/movies/elemental/">
          &lt;p&gt;Okay, so ostensibly this is a movie about the immigrant experience in New York City. This theme is about as subtle as a very unsubtle thing, which isn&#x27;t bad! Subtle themes fly over the heads of most audiences, and this is a story worth telling clearly. It&#x27;s based on the director Peter Sohn&#x27;s experience as the son of Korean immigrants in the 1970s. Promising idea, right?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well &lt;em&gt;Elemental&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; starts off on the right foot. It constructs a beautiful and fantastical place called &quot;Element City&quot; that manages to be a fine depiction of New York City. It&#x27;s a bustling city with a diverse and growing immigrant population. Everyone&#x27;s just trying to carve out a happy life for themselves in a society that is structurally stacked against them.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The main character— Ember Lumen (Leah Lewis)— and her family own a convenience store which mirrors Sohn&#x27;s own childhood in the Bronx. The Lumens have to work long hours, money is tight, and they have to deal with vandalism and poorly maintained infrastructure with seemingly no support from the local government or community.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That poorly maintained infrastructure is exactly how the shoehorned romance plot begins because a water person named Wade (Mamoudou Athie) floods into the basement of their convenience store. Like the start of all good romance plots, the characters apologize after bumping into each other, clean up the mess, and the spark of romance becomes a flame of passion (heh).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just kidding, that&#x27;s not what happened at all! Wade is a city inspector who does nothing to clean up the mess. Instead, he plans to report the broken plumbing to the city while being fully aware this would result in Ember&#x27;s family store being shut down and them losing their livlihood. All of this over some plumbing that was apparently overloaded due to a leak in the canal that the city maintains. Nothing&#x27;s dreamier than a guy who&#x27;s willing to destroy your family over a technicality I guess.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Trying to get Wade&#x27;s boss, Gale (Wendi McLendon-Covey) to forgive the unfair citation Wade wrote in the first place is the main driver of the rest of the plot. Gale agrees to forgive the citation in exchange for finding the source of a leak in the canal. This was Wade&#x27;s job to begin with, but now Ember is essentially being blackmailed to help out too. Gale even tells them to hire a crew to fix the leak! What kind of a city is this?&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To me, the only rational explanation is that this is a depiction of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Institutional_racism&quot;&gt;systematic racism&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. It evokes things like &quot;&lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.npr.org&#x2F;2016&#x2F;11&#x2F;01&#x2F;500104506&#x2F;broken-windows-policing-and-the-origins-of-stop-and-frisk-and-how-it-went-wrong&quot;&gt;broken windows policing&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;&quot;, the &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Flint_water_crisis&quot;&gt;Flint water crisis&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, the injustice of &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;San_Antonio_Independent_School_District_v._Rodriguez&quot;&gt;San Antonio Independent School District v. Rodriguez&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;, or any other case of racial hierarchies being systematically enforced.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And that&#x27;s exactly what&#x27;s happening in Element City. The city is literally built to be hostile to fire people, such as the elevated subway that sends deadly splashes of water down to the streets where Ember does deliveries. At some point, Ember visits Wade&#x27;s family, which lives in the richer part of town in a giant skyscraper surrounded by deadly water features, showcasing the wealth disparity in the city. So it&#x27;s no wonder that a city built and run entirely by non-fire people would subject the community of fire people to unsafe living conditions and refuse to do anything about it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now we&#x27;re at a crossroads in the plot. Will the movie maturely engage with its own depiction of racism? The answer is no. I&#x27;m not expecting the characters to rise up and single-handedly &quot;solve&quot; racism, but to totally brush off the situation they&#x27;re in at every turn feels like the writers are &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;en.wikipedia.org&#x2F;wiki&#x2F;Normalization_(sociology)&quot;&gt;normalizing&lt;&#x2F;a&gt; it.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ember and Wade did find and fix the leak in the canal using sand melted into glass. Gale inspects the (clearly fragile) fix and deems it safe. But of course, it breaks, massively flooding the area where most of the fire people live.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In real life, floods of that size are generally deadly, so I can&#x27;t imagine all of the fire people survived even though there were no on-screen deaths. So Gale&#x27;s incompetence lead to the likely deaths of many people and the destruction of their homes, but suffers no consequences and doesn&#x27;t even appear in the film after inspecting the fix. Also in real life, when marginalized groups experience hardship, sometimes they come together as a community in beautiful ways, just like &lt;a href=&quot;https:&#x2F;&#x2F;www.nbcnews.com&#x2F;news&#x2F;latino&#x2F;nyc-forgot-bronx-latinos-blacks-saved-it-says-new-documentary-n1074786&quot;&gt;what happened in the Bronx in the 70s&lt;&#x2F;a&gt;. Grassroots groups organized to keep city services running when &quot;the area’s elected officials... were mostly corrupt and disinterested in helping their constituents&quot;.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;No similar grassroots organizing happened in &lt;em&gt;Elemental&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, which I feel like is a pretty glaring omission. Seeing that preventable disaster happen and having the focus suddenly shift to the Ember-Wade romance plot just felt so unsatisfying. It really broke the spell and made me realize I was just sitting in a theater consuming a piece of mass media that has nothing revolutionary to say, despite teeing it up very well. Revolutionary things and big box office numbers don&#x27;t mix, and &lt;em&gt;Elemental&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; didn&#x27;t have either.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          Well animated, but extremely tone-deaf. 3 out of 10.

          &lt;p&gt;I think I&#x27;ve definitely got a soft spot for 90&#x27;s-00&#x27;s movies, and &lt;em&gt;The Parent Trap&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is an exemplar, which earns its high score from me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I can&#x27;t remember exactly why I knocked off half of a point, possibly it was the fake British accent (Lindsay Lohan did her best).&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          Funny, heart-felt, and easily rewatchable. 9.5 out of 10.

          &lt;p&gt;Initial discussion around this movie decried it as a cash-grab, since it&#x27;s &quot;just&quot; people talking in an office building. Easy to shoot, easy to light, no need to deal with weather, no stunts, no CGI, etc.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That&#x27;s all true, but another way to think of it is that the script and the actors can&#x27;t hide behind anything. I watch a lot of competition shows, and every time a contestant says &quot;I&#x27;m going for something simple&quot;, the judges always say &quot;alright, but it better be absolutely perfect&quot;. &lt;em&gt;Air&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; does just that.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          Funny, emotional, compelling, and Viola Davis absolutely did it to 'em. 10 out of 10.

          &lt;p&gt;I don&#x27;t think I need to write much to justify giving a perfect score to probably the greatest independent film to come out this decade.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My scoring system gives a lot of weight to &quot;missed opportunities&quot;, and this film doesn&#x27;t miss. Amazing story, characters, acting, message, visuals, and everything else I can think of.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The other part of my scoring system is more feeling-based. How I see it, movies either show a fake, fantastical world where the good guys always win, or they show the real, messy world that has no rhyme or reason. By embracing absurdism and approaching it honestly, the movie manages to do what I thought was impossible: present a unique message that rings true, while also managing to be uplifting.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          Entrancing, impressive, and oddly reassuring. 10 out of 10.

          &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;80 for Brady&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; had great marketing since the concept is so inherently funny. We watched all three of Jane Fonda&#x27;s movies in 2023 (how does she do it?) and this is the best one. But with such a great concept comes high expectations of the comedy, which didn&#x27;t land for me.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Despite this flaw, I think it can hold up as any other classic feel-good comedy. Something about the editing or the music feels nostalgic, hearkening back to sport-comedies around the 2000s like maybe &lt;em&gt;Talladega Nights&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Waterboy&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;Dodgeball&lt;&#x2F;em&gt;. I guess &lt;em&gt;80 for Brady&lt;&#x2F;em&gt; is a bit more serious than those movies, especially the thing Jane Fonda&#x27;s character is being secretive about, culminating in her (amazing) monologue. But like all those other movies, they aren&#x27;t that laugh-out-loud funny, but consistently funny enough and well-written enough to become classics.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For all those reasons, we ended up watching this movie again a year later. Just like those other classic movies, it&#x27;s eminently rewatchable, which is higher praise than the middling score implies.&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          Enjoyable, but didn't live up to its comedic potential. 7 out of 10.

          &lt;p&gt;This was our first movie since we started tracking movie scores. In a way, it inspired us to start keeping track and to sign up for a movie theater subscription!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;

          Great characters, a clear plot, and punchlines that hit, unlike the musical numbers. 8 out of 10.
