    <p>I loved <em>Twisters</em>, and I'm not even a fan of the genre which is a testament to its quality. The concept of a smug influencer storm chaser meeting a by-the-books meterologist is just inherently entertaining. Glen Powell has made a fan of me due to his performance that another reviewer called worthy of "an Oscar for smugness".</p>
<p>Seeing this movie near the opening night in a packed theater also helped the experience. With so many movies coming out in theaters and on streaming services, it's like the concept of a "blockbuster" has been lost in recent years. You can't have a cultural moment centered around a dozen different movies every year, much to the chagrin of studio execs. It's only possible in moderation.</p>
<p>Given <em>Twister (1996)</em> already had a committed fanbase, people showed up to the theater wearing custom T-shirts and left with big smiles. Critics didn't like either the original movie or this remake very much, but I can tell you this is one of those times where the critics are missing the forest for the trees.</p>
<p>If you're entertained by artsyness, then <em>Twisters</em> is not for you. If you're entertained by endearing idiots shooting fireworks into a tornado while blasting <em>Ain't No Love In Oklahoma</em>, then this movie is pure entertainment from start to finish.</p>
